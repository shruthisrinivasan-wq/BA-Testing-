Business Specification: Mobile Faster Payments
Project Name: Mobile Instant Transfers (RTP) Platform: iOS & Android (Native) Version: 1.0 Status: Draft

1. Executive Summary
To enable retail customers to initiate Single Immediate Payments (SIP) directly from their mobile device. The feature leverages native device capabilities (Biometrics, Push Notifications) to provide a secure, frictionless payment experience with settlement in under 15 seconds.

2. Scope
In Scope:

One-off domestic payments (Person-to-Person/Business).

Biometric Authentication (FaceID / TouchID / Android Biometrics) for transaction signing.

Payee Management: Add new, save existing, and delete payees.

Confirmation of Payee (CoP): Name checking overlay.

Share Receipt: Native OS "Share Sheet" integration (PDF/Image).

Out of Scope:

Bulk payments / Batch processing.

International payments (SWIFT/SEPA).

Standing Order management (view only, not creation).

3. Functional Requirements
3.1. Payment Initiation
Entry Point: "Pay" floating action button (FAB) or dedicated tab on the bottom navigation bar.

Source Account: Carousel view of available accounts. User swipes to select the debiting account.

Recent Payees: Display a horizontal scroll list of the top 5 most frequent payees for "1-tap" selection.

3.2. New Payee Setup
Input Fields: Name, Sort Code, Account Number, Reference.

Keypad: App must trigger the numeric keypad automatically for Sort Code and Account Number fields to reduce user error.

Validation: Local validation (RegEx) to ensure 6-digit Sort Code and 8-digit Account Number before enabling the "Continue" button.

3.3. Confirmation of Payee (CoP)
Execution: Upon tapping "Continue," the app initiates an API call to validate the account name.

UI Feedback:

Match: Green checkmark icon next to the payee name.

No Match/Close Match: A modal bottom-sheet warns the user. The "Confirm" button is disabled for 3 seconds to force reading the warning.

3.4. Transaction Signing (SCA)
Constraint: Use Native Biometrics instead of SMS OTP for a faster flow.

Fallback: If biometrics fail 3 times or are unavailable, revert to Device Passcode or App PIN.

Transaction Binding: The biometric prompt must explicitly display the Amount and Payee Name (Dynamic Linking) to comply with PSD2/SCA standards.

3.5. Post-Transaction & Notifications
Push Notification: If the app is backgrounded while the payment is "Pending," a Push Notification must be sent once the final status (Success/Fail) is received.

Receipt: "Share Receipt" button triggers the native OS sharing menu (send via WhatsApp, Email, Slack, etc.).

4. Mobile UI/UX Flow
Tap "Pay": Bottom navigation.

Select Payee: List view or tap "Add New" (+).

Enter Amount: Large text input.

Smart Logic: If user copies an account number to clipboard outside the app, prompt "Paste from Clipboard?" upon return.

Review (CoP): Screen displays details. CoP status shown clearly.

Authorize: Native OS Biometric prompt appears ("Double click side button" or Fingerprint).

Processing Animation: Full-screen spinner. App must not allow the user to go "Back" during this state.

Success Screen: Green tick animation with "Done" button.

5. Non-Functional Requirements (Mobile Specific)
5.1. Connectivity & Resilience
Network Fluctuation: The app must handle switching between WiFi and 4G/5G gracefully without dropping the session.

Timeout: If the backend does not respond within 15 seconds, the app must display a "Status Unknown - Checking" screen rather than a "Failure," and poll for the result.

5.2. Performance
App Launch to Payment: A returning user must be able to complete a payment to a saved payee in < 4 taps and < 10 seconds total interaction time.

Battery: The module must not excessively drain battery (e.g., disable location services during payment flow).

5.3. Security
App Switching: If the user minimizes the app during the "Review" phase and returns > 60 seconds later, the flow must reset to the dashboard for security.

Jailbreak/Root Detection: Payment functionality is disabled on rooted/jailbroken devices.

Screen Recording: The app must block OS screen recording/screenshots on the "Payment Details" screen (Android FLAG_SECURE).

6. Edge Cases
Incoming Call: If a phone call interrupts the flow, the app preserves the state (input data is not lost).

Insufficient Funds: Display a clear error message with a "Add Money" CTA if possible.

Duplicate Payment: If the user attempts to pay the exact same amount to the same payee within 5 minutes, display a warning: "You just sent this payment. Send again?"
