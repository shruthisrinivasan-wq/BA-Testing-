Business Specification: Faster Payments Module
Project Name: Instant Transfer Integration (Retail) Version: 1.0 Status: Draft

1. Executive Summary
The objective is to implement a "Faster Payments" capability allowing retail customers to send single, immediate payments to domestic beneficiaries (Person-to-Person or Person-to-Business) via the web application. The goal is a transaction settlement time of under 15 seconds, available 24/7/365.

2. Scope
In Scope: Single immediate domestic transfers, New Payee setup, Confirmation of Payee (CoP) checks, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/SCA), Transaction Receipt generation.

Out of Scope: Standing Orders, Direct Debits, International (SWIFT/SEPA) payments, Bulk corporate payments.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1. Payment Initiation
The user must be able to initiate a payment from the "Accounts" dashboard.

Source Account: User selects the debiting account.

Balance Check: System must validate Available Balance >= Payment Amount.

3.2. Payee Management & Input
The system must allow payment to a New Payee or a Saved Payee.

Required Data Fields: | Field Name | Type | Validation Rule | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Payee Name | String | Max 35 chars. Alphanumeric. | | Sort Code | Numeric | 6 digits. Must pass Modulus Check. | | Account Number | Numeric | 8 digits. Must pass Modulus Check. | | Payment Reference | String | Max 18 chars. No special chars (creates statement noise). | | Amount | Currency | Min £0.01, Max £10,000 (Daily Cap). |

3.3. Confirmation of Payee (CoP)
Before submission, the system must query the destination bank to match the Account Name against the Account Number/Sort Code.

Match: Display green checkmark.

Close Match: Display warning ("Name matches partially").

No Match: Display high-level warning ("Account name does not match"). User must explicitly acknowledge risk to proceed.

3.4. Security & Authentication (SCA)
Upon clicking "Confirm Payment," the user must pass Strong Customer Authentication.

Method: Push notification to mobile app OR SMS One-Time Passcode (OTP).

Session Timeout: If the user takes > 5 minutes on the payment screen, the session times out.

3.5. Transaction Processing
System deducts funds immediately (ledger update).

System sends ISO 8583/20022 message to the Faster Payments Gateway.

System awaits specific response codes (Success, Pending, Rejected).

4. User Interface (UI) Flow
Dashboard: Click "Make a Payment."

Select Payee: Choose "New" or select from list.

Input Details: Enter amount and reference.

Review Screen: Summary of payment. (CoP Result shown here).

Challenge: 2FA/Biometric prompt.

Result Screen:

Success: "Payment Sent. Transaction ID: #12345."

Failure: "Payment Declined. Reason: [User Friendly Message]."

5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
5.1. Performance & Latency
End-to-End Latency: The UI must display the Success/Failure result within < 5 seconds of the user entering their 2FA code.

Throughput: System must handle up to 500 concurrent payment requests per second.

5.2. Availability
Service must be available 99.99% of the time.

Planned downtime must be communicated 48 hours in advance via banner.

5.3. Compliance & Security
Encryption: All data in transit must use TLS 1.3.

AML: Transactions over a certain threshold (hidden logic) must trigger an asynchronous fraud check.

Audit: All attempts (successful or failed) must be logged in the immutable audit trail.

6. Assumptions & Constraints
The Core Banking System (ledger) exposes an API for real-time balance holding.

The bank has an existing contract with a Faster Payments Gateway provider (e.g., ClearBank, Form3, or direct Vocalink connection).

The user has a valid mobile number/device registered for 2FA.
